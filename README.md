# Classification of scenery using machine vision

The goal of the project was to create models for classifying scenery images utilizing deep learning. The project explores the use of data augmentation and showcases various models created using different techniques such as creating an architecture from scratch, using transfer learning for feature extraction and even fine tuning the top layers of a pre-trained model to improve it's capabilities for the project at hand.

## Dataset
